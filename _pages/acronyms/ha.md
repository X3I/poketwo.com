# HA - Hidden Ability

Beginning in Generation V, most Pokémon were given a Hidden Ability. A Pokémon
with its Hidden Ability will retain its ability slot upon evolution, unless the
evolved form has no Hidden Ability.

To understand which ability is considered a Pokémon's Hidden Ability, please use
Google with the query `hidden ability <pokemon>` replacing `<pokemon>` with the
Pokémon name that you're looking for. A comprehensive list is beyond the scope
of this FAQ.

## Getting a Hidden Ability

Hidden Abilities are available in the game, and are obtained via finding Pokémon
in the wild with them. They have a 1% chance of appearing, and it is recommended
to have a Trace ability Pokémon to make HA hunting the most efficient possible.
