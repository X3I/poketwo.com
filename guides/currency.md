# Currencies & Generating Income

## Money (Pokedollars, PK or â‚½)

Money is earned through winning NPC encounters (Trainers, Gym Leaders, the Elite
4 + Champion, etc.).

Additionally, there is an in-game trading economy based around selling Pokemon,
Items, Buffs, Services, almost anything! You have the option of participating in
this to earn PK.

Lastly, there are in-game buffs that allow you to increase the amount of Money
you earn per encounter, or gives you small amounts for Wild Pokemon encounters.

> __Note:__ You can make secondary characters (called alts) and if you have
> multiple computers, trade that money to yourself, or use it for economical
> exchanges.

## Gold Coins

Gold Coins are used as supplemental currency for transactions in the in-game
cosmetic store, and for certain actions such as resetting IVs.

The only way to obtain these currently is Loot Boxes.
