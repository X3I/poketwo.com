# Regions

## Available Regions

* Kanto - http://bit.ly/p1kanto
* Johto - http://bit.ly/p1johto

## Announced Regions

* Unova - Coming in the New Year 2018/2019 (Approximately the first week of January)

There are no concrete plans for any other regions at the current time, but we
imagine they will all be implemented eventually. Unfortunately, there is no
estimated time for them.

## How to Change Regions

To leave Kanto or Johto to the opposite region, you must first beat the
corresponding Elite 4. Only then are you able to go from the Victory Road
entrance building to the new region.
