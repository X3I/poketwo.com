# Daily Bosses

There are numerous Bosses present in the game as of now. They start off at a
high level, and each time you defeat them, their next encounter will have them
at a higher level than the previous. They respawn at 10am UTC/GMT, when the
reset happens, and can be fought everyday. Bosses drop several useful items,
like Evolution items, EV Training items, Hold items, and also will always give
you Trainer EXP and money.
