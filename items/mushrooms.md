# Mushrooms

Mushrooms are used as currency for Learning (and Relearning) moves taught by an
Egg Move Tutor.

## Farming

### Quest

There is a daily quest in Route 4 (before Cerulean City, after Mt. Moon) to help
a girl get Mushrooms from trees. You'll have a chance at a Big Mushroom.

### Farming

You can also farm Mushrooms from Paras & Parasect by defeating them in combat in
the wild.
