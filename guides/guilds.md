# Guilds

Guilds exist as communities within PokeOne. Although there is no strategic value
or particular benefit given by the game for joining one (other than a sweet logo
above your head), each individual guild offers benefits designed for their
community. Check out `#guild-recruitment` for examples and a list of guilds
looking for members like you!

## Create a Guild

To create a guild, navigate to the `Social` menu (two blue chat bubbles) in the
top right corner of your screen. Then, select the `Guild` tab and use the Create
guild button. This will cost 1000 gold coins.

## Leaving a Guild

To leave a guild, navigate to the `Social` menu (two blue chat bubbles) in the
top right corner of your screen. Then, select the `Roster` tab, scroll down
until you see your name. Right Click yourself, and select `Leave Guild`
