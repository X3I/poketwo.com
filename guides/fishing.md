# Fishing

Fishing is a way to catch Pokémon in the water. In fact, some Pokémon can only
be caught by using a Fishing Rod.

## Fishing Rods

Fishing Rods are included in the game to allow the player to Fish wherever there
is an open water space.

There are three different types of rods each allowes the player to fish for
differing types of Pokémon.

* __Old Rod__
  The Old Rod is usually the first rod to be obtained by the player and is also
  the weakest of the three as it will only allow the player to fish for
  Magikarps and other common water type Pokemon.
* __Good Rod__
  The Good Rod is the second rod to be obtained by the player, and opens up more
  types of Pokémon able to be caught.
* __Super Rod__
  The Super Rod is the last rod to be obtained, and with it it's possible to
  fish for all types of Pokémon in any area.
