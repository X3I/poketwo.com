# Controls

Here is a simplified overview of game controls:

* Movement is controlled by `W` `A` `S` `D` - Corresponded with UP, LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT - You can also use the Arrow keys.
* `SPACE` is your primary interaction key, use it for almost everything.
* `SHIFT` Is a hotkey for your Bicycle or Mount, if you have one. Mounts do not count as Bicycles for Bicycle Road, if you do not already have a Bicycle.
* Flight is controlled with `W` `S` `Q` `E` `Space` `Shift` and the right mouse button - Corresponds with FORWARD, BACKWARD, TURN LEFT, TURN RIGHT, UP, DOWN and the right mouse button is another way of turning which you may feel more comfortable with since you only need to click and hold the button while dragging your mouse around.

> __Note:__ Currently there is no support for custom key bindings.
