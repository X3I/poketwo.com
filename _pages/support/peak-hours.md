  If you are experiencing login queue issues, registration problems, a black screen when you log in, the inability to use HMs, inability to interact with anything, missing items, buffs or Pokémon, please check #announcements for the latest information

  The servers are currently under extreme load.

  You have two options for the time being:

  1. Continually try logging in, and experience the game in a degraded state, or
  2. Come back later when the servers have recovered, during non-peak hours.

  We understand that you want to play, and we apologize, but until the servers
  have recovered, this is the best we can do for you. Every effort is being made
  to address the servers stability.

  Peak Hours are roughly 5:00 PM - 12:00 AM UTC. You should convert this to your timezone.
