# In Game Time and Day Resets

In game time is not the same as where you are. Both the in game time and day
resets do not follow your exact time. The time the day resets is utc-10. When
the link attached resets/ turns 0:00, a new day has begun.
https://time.is/UTC-10

As for in game time, it is 5x as fast as time in the real world. The game uses
the 5th Generation Season system, so day and night cycle varies however use the
following as a base guide, different times for the sections of the day (in game
time is) 6:00 AM starts Morning, Day starts at 11, Evening starts at 4:00 PM,
and night starts at 6:00 PM.
