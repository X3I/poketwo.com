# Guilds

Guilds exist as communities within PokéOne. Although there is no strategic value
or particular benefit given by the game for joining one (other than a sweet logo
above your head), each individual guild offers benefits designed for their
community. Check out `#guild-recruitment` for examples and a list of guilds
looking for members like you!

## Create a Guild

To create a guild, navigate to the `Social` menu (two blue chat bubbles) in the
top right corner of your screen. <br/>Then, select the `Guild` tab and use the Create
guild button. This will cost 1000 gold coins.

## Joining a Guild

You can join an existing guild by being invited by one of the members.

## Leaving a Guild

To leave a guild, navigate to the `Social` menu (two blue chat bubbles) in the
top right corner of your screen. <br/>Then, select the `Roster` tab, scroll down
until you see your name. Right Click yourself, and select `Leave Guild`

## Guild Logo's

It is impossible to import an image directly to your logo, 
you'll need to customize it yourself on a 32x32 grid.<br/>
Closest method you have for replication is juxtaposing it 
against the image you want <br/>(preferably on the 32x32 scale) 
and cross-checking it to ensure exactitude.
