# Pokémon Natures

Pokémon natures are another key feature of the games, which can increase certain
stats. Each Pokémon has one nature, randomly selected from a total of 25.

Rather than just being a superficial personality, Natures actually affect the
growth of a Pokémon. Each nature increases one of its stats by 10% and decreases
one by 10% (by the time it reaches level 100). Five natures increase and
decrease the same stat and therefore have no effect.

In most cases it is preferable to have a nature that decreases either Attack or
Special Attack for Pokémon whose strengths are the opposite type of attack.
Espeon, for example, favours Special moves, so it's best to use a nature that
decreases its Attack since it won't be used.

## Berries

A Pokémon's nature also determines the berries it likes and dislikes. Each type
of berry is linked to one stat:

* Attack - Spicy
* Defense - Sour
* Speed - Sweet
* Sp. Attack - Dry
* Sp. Defense - Bitter

The berry a Pokémon likes is the corresponding flavour of its raised stat, while
the berry it dislikes is the flavour of its lowered stat.

For example, a Pokémon of Sassy nature will like Bitter berries (Special Defense
is raised) and dislike Sweet berries (Speed is lowered).

## Natures by stat

Find which nature corresponds to your preferred stat boosts/drops.

|               | ↓ Attack  | ↓ Defense  | ↓ Sp. Atk   | ↓ Sp. Def  | ↓ Speed     |
|--------------:|:---------:|:----------:|:-----------:|:----------:|:-----------:|
| ↑ **Attack**  | **Hardy** | Lonely     | Adamant     | Naughty    | Brave       |
| ↑ **Defense** | Bold      | **Docile** | Impish      | Lax        | Relaxed     |
| ↑ **Sp. Atk** | Modest    | Mild       | **Bashful** | Rash       | Quiet       |
| ↑ **Sp. Def** | Calm      | Gentle     | Careful     | **Quirky** | Sassy       |
| ↑ **Speed**   | Timid     | Hasty      | Jolly       | Naive      | **Serious** |

> __Note:__ Bolded natures have no effect, because they both increase and
> decrease the same state. These are considered Neutral Natures.
