# Silph Co.

The Silph Company, or simply Silph Co., is a company headquartered in Saffron
City. They are the manufacturers of many tools, including the Silph Scope—a
device that allows the user to view spectral entities—as well as home
appliances. They are also speculated to run the Poké Marts in Kanto as well as
in Johto and the Sevii Islands.

Due to Team Rocket having invaded the Silph Co. headquarters in Saffron City, a
Team Rocket Grunt is initially guarding the front door, preventing entrance into
the building. After the player has saved Mr. Silph from Team Rocket at the
Pokémon Tower in Lavender Town, the guard will have disappeared, allowing the
player to enter the building.
