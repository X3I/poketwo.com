# Fishing Rods

These are the locations that you can acquire Fishing Rods:

If you are in Kanto:

- [Super Rod] - Route 12, found in the House
- [Good Rod] - Fuchsia City, talk to the guy in the house with a pond behind it
- [Old Rod] - Vermillion City (Talk to the people found in the house near the
  Pokémon Center and talk to the girl. Then read the bookcases, and go back to
  the old man on the dock.

If you are in Johto:

- [Super Rod] - Lake of Rage

To use a Rod, face water in front of yourself, open your Backpack, and click the
fishing rod. If a Pokémon is not caught, walk 5 steps (generally side to side
works best) to reset the counter on the middle-top area of your screen. Rinse
and repeat.
