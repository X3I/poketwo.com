# Economical Questions

The `#community-support` channel is not the correct place for economical questions.

You should look for help in:

* The `#buy-sell-trade` discord channel
* The `#Trade` channel in game (You can manually add this channel in game)
* Cerulean City & Goldenrod City `#Map` - These are economical trade hubs, with lots
  of people willing to provide information.
* Or, try `#general` (or `#general-{language}` for your appropriate language)
