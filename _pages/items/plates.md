# Plates

A Plate is a type of held item. There is one Plate for each type, except Normal. They boost the power of the holder's moves of the corresponding type, and change Arceus and its signature move Judgment to that type.

## Location

One random plate can be obtained each day from the captain of the S.S. Aqua - **Captain Rodriguez**. S.S. Aqua  is a ferry service that runs between Johto (Olivine City) and Kanto (Vermillion City) changing its location daily and has a day off every few days.
