# Legendaries

For the time being, only the legendary trios for Kanto and Johto are obtainable.

## Kanto

The legendary birds:

* Moltres - Found in Victory Road ([Map](/img/maps/moltres.png))
* Zapdos - Found in the Power Plant ([Map](/img/maps/zapdos.png))
* Articuno - Found in Seafoam Islands.

  To find Articuno, enter from the South Entrance, Rock Smash go up the stairs and left. Then up the ladder across the ice and to the ladder on the right top. Then down and left to the next ladder and poof you are there

## Johto

* Entei - Found in the Dark Cave
* Raikou - Found on Route 45
* Suicune - Found via a quest that starts in Cianwood

## Stats

Legendaries do not benefit from the Synchronize ability, alongside all other
static encounter Pokémon, making popular Ability & Nature combinations much more
valuable.

## Catch Rate & Respawning

Each Legendary Pokémon can only be caught once, per account.

If you kill a Legendary Pokémon during your encounter with them, a new spawn
(with new, randomized values) will be available in 1 week (7 real-world days).

## Why can't I catch [insert legendary name here]?

All Legendary Pokémon not listed on this page are implemented as
[Bosses](/guides/bosses), and are not catchable.
