# Pokémon Mansion

The Pokémon Mansion is a decrepit, burned-down mansion on Cinnabar Island. It
got its name because a famous Pokémon Researcher once lived there.

To access the Cinnabar Island Gym, the player has to enter the mansion and find
the Secret Key to unlock the door of the Gym.

The Pokémon Mansion has four different floors. Doors can be unlocked in the
Mansion by pressing switches hidden in Mewtwo statues.

Amongst the rubble and wreckage is information written by the scientist who
obtained a Mew and cloned it to create Mewtwo.

## Finding the Secret Key

In order to reach the Secret Key, you must Activate a Statue on each floor, then
navigate to the Jumping point shown below, and fall down to the basement.
