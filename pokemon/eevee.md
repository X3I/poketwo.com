# Eevee

Eevee can only be obtained twice by a single player; once per region. They are
gifted to you at two locations.

## Kanto

## Johto

* Ecruteak City Pokémon Center - Top Floor

There are no plans for implementing Eevee as a Wild encounter for now.

## Eeveelutions

All eeveelutions exist in the game, __except__ Glaceon and Leafeon (for now).

### Hidden Abilities

Eeveelutions can obtain their HA with Eevee having either the ‘Run Away' or ‘Adaptability' abilities.
