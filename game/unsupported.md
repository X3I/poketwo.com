# Unsupported Features (That People Consistently Ask About)

Here are some common features that are asked about, and some descriptions as to
them not existing in the game

## Mega Evolutions

For all intents and purposes, Mega Evolutions are not in the game. The
developers have actually created them, but they are not yet accessible to play
with, and there is no ETA for their activation.

## Breeding and XP Share

There will never be breeding or the XP Share. The reason for this is we have IV
resets, and breeding doesn't lend itself well to an MMO game.

## Razor Claw & Razor Scale

These items are not currently in the game.
