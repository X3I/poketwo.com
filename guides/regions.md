# Regions

## Available Regions

A player has the opportunity to play each of the following Regions in the game:

* Kanto - ([Map](http://bit.ly/p1kanto))
* Johto - ([Map](http://bit.ly/p1johto))

After completing a region and going to the next, your Player level will be
reset to Level 5, but you will not lose any previous Pok√©mon or their progress.
They will however be capped in battle to your Player level, allowing you to
progress within a normal power curve.

## Announced Regions

* Unova - Coming in the New Year 2018/2019 (Approximately the first week of January)

There are no concrete plans for any other regions at the current time, but we
imagine they will all be implemented eventually. Unfortunately, there is no
estimated time for them.

## How to Change Regions

To leave Kanto or Johto to the opposite region, you must first beat the
corresponding Elite 4. Only then are you able to go from the Victory Road
entrance building to the new region.
